## 2026-11-02 — Wave 4 complete: higher-half nucleus (M4)

**Did:** W4-S01..S09. A C nucleus ELF linked at `0xffffffff80100000` with one PT_LOAD per permission set. The loader gained pure, host-tested modules: `palloc` (bump frame allocator over E820), `image` (read a manifest entry through `block_device` + CRC), `elf_load` (validate every segment before copying any), `paging` + `vmsetup` (4-level tables: identity 1 GiB, physmap of all RAM at `0xffff800000000000` with NX, nucleus with 4 KiB W^X pages). boot_info v2 adds `physmap_base` and a module list at `0x1100`. The loader enables EFER.NXE, loads CR3 and jumps with `RDI = physmap + 0x1000`; the nucleus validates v2 through the physmap and prints `BURROW:NUCLEUS:OK`. New smoke file `boot_to_nucleus.txt` (checked with `boot_to_loader.txt` on the same boot), REG-0004 (corrupt nucleus), GitHub Actions CI running `make test` and the Mermaid check.

**Numbers:** 152 host C checks; nucleus 10 KiB on disk; page tables 8 frames for 128 MiB of RAM.

**Surprises:**
- The regression harness silently dropped a case whose mutator failed (BUG-0005). The totals looked fine.
- Two segments sharing a page would break W^X; `pt_map` refusing to overwrite turns that into a loud `already mapped` instead of a silent permission merge.
- `kprintf` has no `-` flag: `%-14s` printed literally and shifted every argument after it. Caught by reading the smoke log, not by a test.

**Learned:** Giving `paging.c` fake physical addresses in host tests (a pool at `0x40000000`) proves it never mixes a physical address with a pointer, which identity-mapped QEMU runs could never show.

**Next:** W5 nucleus: GDT/TSS/IDT first, so a fault prints a register dump instead of a silent triple fault. Then a PMM fed by the E820 map minus the boot modules.

## 2026-11-02 — Waves 0-3 complete: boot to C loader (M0-M3)

**Did:** Built the repo skeleton, contracts (`boot_info.h`, `manifest.h`, `boot_abi.inc`), `mkimage` with Go tests, stage1, stage2 (A20, E820, manifest, chunked load, CPUID, boot_info, protected mode, CRC verify, identity paging, long mode), and the C loader (kprintf on `char_sink`, serial, memory map, manifest validation, self-CRC, ATA PIO cross-check). Harness: 39 host C checks under ASan/UBSan, Go tests, ordered-marker smoke test with debug-exit, regression suite of mutated images.

**Numbers:** stage1 282/446 bytes, stage2 1502/16384, loader 6024 bytes. Full `make test` under 5 seconds.

**Surprises:**
- First QEMU boot of the full chain passed on the first try, because each contract had been written down before the code.
- The regression suite found a *design* flaw (BUG-0003): a corrupted loader cannot be trusted to check itself. Fixed by verifying in stage2 before executing ("verify before you execute").
- Failure paths that just `hlt` made regression tests wait for a 20 s timeout. Adding debug-exit to every failure path took the suite from 40 s to 0.5 s.

**Learned:** Testing negative paths (broken images) is as valuable as the happy path; it tested our *error handling*, which nothing else exercises.

**Next:** W4 higher-half hand-off. Read MEMORY_MAP §2 first.

## 2026-11-02 — Research and design (pre-W0)

**Did:** Surveyed Biscuit, eggos, gopher-os, TamaGo, the GOOS=none proposal, TinyGo, gVisor, doomgeneric ([RESEARCH.md](../01-research/RESEARCH.md)). Chose: asm → C loader → resident C nucleus → stock Go kernel on a Linux-syscall shim (ADR-0001, ADR-0003).

**Experiment:** Ran a syscall census of a Go 1.22 program (22 distinct syscalls). Discovered the runtime reserves >1 GiB of `PROT_NONE` address space at start-up, passes TLS via `CLONE_SETTLS`, and checks fds 0-2 with `fcntl`. Linking at `-T 0x7e0000000000` works. All three went straight into the design (PIT-05, GO_RUNTIME_HOSTING §4).

**Surprise:** Compile-checking the Doom backend snippet found that `<linux/input.h>` and `doomkeys.h` both define `KEY_ENTER` (BUG-0004).

**Next:** W0.
